# fpga-audio-pipeline
FPGA-based audio sampling pipeline using the ADS1015 ADC over I²C, with real-time UART transmission to a Python interface. Includes Verilog implementation, DSP in Python (bias removal, normalization), .wav export, and signal analysis via FFT. Built on Basys 3 at up to 2400 SPS.
